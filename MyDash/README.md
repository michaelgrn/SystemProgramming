MyDash is a shell designed for Linux x64 architecture, has been run on RedHat OS 7 and Mint OS 20. The functionality of this shell is several fold. The first several iterations were designed to handle recursively calling itself and maintaing a history of commands. As the program grew more complex, signal handling was added; enabling jobs to be running in the background and the foreground while maintaining a list of currently running jobs. Additional features include version control monitoring and logging of errors.
